# HW_for_AI_Challange_28# Memristor Model and Simulation (Biolek Model)

## ðŸ”¹ Summary ðŸ”¹

This project involves **modeling and simulating a memristor** â€” a two-terminal electronic component whose resistance evolves based on its history of current flow.  
Memristors are a key building block for **neuromorphic computing and adaptable synaptic weights**.  
This makes them especially valuable for developing **self-learning circuits and chips**.

## ðŸ”¹ Challenge ðŸ”¹

This project was implemented to solve Challenge #28:

> Model and simulate a memristor (using the **Biolek Model**).
> Visualize its pinched Iâ€“V curve under sinusoidal voltage stimulus.

## ðŸ”¹ How I Got Here (Vibe Coding Procedure) ðŸ”¹

When I first started this challenge, I wanted to appreciate **memristorsâ€™ unique properties**.  
I began by researching their mathematical models, choosing **Biolekâ€™s Model** due to its simplicity and physical significance.

I then implemented this from scratch in **Python**.  
Instead of adding a large number of files or a heavy framework, I kept it lightweight â€” just **Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib**.  
This lets me directly visualize their **currentâ€“voltage (Iâ€“V) characteristics** and see the **pinched hysteresis loop** form under sinusoidal stimulus.

I implemented:
- The **memristorâ€™s state variable (w)** evolves based on **current flow and a window function**, which prevents it from growing outside its physical bounds.
- The **current** is governed by Ohmâ€™s Law with a state-dependent resistance.

## ðŸ”¹ Findings and Results ðŸ”¹

Running the script produces **the well-known pinched Iâ€“V curve**, which crosses origin (V = 0, I = 0) in a symmetric trajectory:

- The slope evolves depending on its state â€” reflecting its memory of previous signals.
- This shows how **memristors can retain information even after the stimulus is gone**, which forms the basis for their applications in neuromorphic computing, memory storage, and adaptive circuits.
